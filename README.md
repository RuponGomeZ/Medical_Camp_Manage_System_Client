## üîê JWT Authentication Flow

1. After logging in via Firebase on the frontend, user email is sent to:
   ```
   POST https://medicalcampmanagesystemserver-70oakl2as-rupongomezs-projects.vercel.app/jwt
   ```
2. Server generates a JWT token and sets it as a secure HTTP-only cookie.
3. Token is sent with every request to protected routes.
4. On logout, the cookie is cleared:
   ```
   GET https://medicalcampmanagesystemserver-70oakl2as-rupongomezs-projects.vercel.app/logout
   ```
